# DataPreprocessingTool
A simple tool for bulk processing of .csv files

Feel free to make changes to the code where necessary. 

It was made using YouTube, StackOverflow and the documentation for different programs.

I am very much a novice programmer, so there will definitely be improvements that can be made!

Please make sure to keep my name on the program :)


Piloting note: This option currently does not work as intended. If you are using a version before 2025, it does not save the name as "pilot". Additionally if you change the name from "pilot" in a 2025 version, the program will be unable to exclude them.

### Change Log

01/09/2025 - Moved the pilot select options into the select folder area, to force a choice before folder selection, to ensure pilot selection remains accurate

02/09/2025 - Removed redundant code. Created a helper function to streamline iterating over .csv files

24/09/2025 - Added a helper function and changed the filename saves, so that it does not save conditions files as floats when they should be integers.

### To Do
- Move to a better UI
- Speed up the initial loading of the folder location
- Further minor changes to code to improve efficiency
